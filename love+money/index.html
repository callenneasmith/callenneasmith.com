        1. What do you see as your real talents — what puts you head and shoulders above anyone else who’s applying for an internship? Are these things you want to develop further or do you want to focus on areas you aren’t so great at? If the latter, what are those things then?
      </div>

      <div class="goal">
        Whilst I wish this was more straight forward, I find it hard to pinpoint where my specific talents are. I think one of the major reasons why I was accepted into the program was because of my attitude and eagerness. I have always expressed interest in design and LAM as a studio - I have also made a serious effort to dip my toes into as many facets and touchstones of design  as possible. <br> <br> 
        I think where my real strengths lie is within web design. I love creating systems, platforms and spaces where people can interact and explore. Although I have minimal UI/UX experience, It is an area where I have much interest within. This, coupled with branding is where I see myself in the future - I enjoy creating the bigger picture and making all piecing of the puzzle fit. I want to use this internship opportunity to explore my strengths deeper and to find out other areas of design I am interested within. On a personal level I am excited to take on this role as an opportunity for character building. One week down and I am overwhelmed (In all the best ways) by how quick and efficiently everyone works and more importantly, I am inspired by how passionate the whole team is about their particular role.

        2. What is your understanding of brand? What’s the difference between creating a brand and doing some really sexy design or TOV? How does your role fit into the overall project?
      </div>

      <div class="goal">
        Brand describes all the tangible and non-tangible elements that make up a "thing". Poor use of words I know - But this means that a brand need to have congruence and consistency across all it's outputs. In the digital age, a brand isn't just logos, posters and business cards. It is the designer's role to translate and reintepret the otherwise invisible elements of a brand such as it's purpose, mission and personality across all platforms where audiences may interact with it. <br> <br>
        Sexy design pieces look fantastic but they are fragile and brittle. Without considering a brand's intangible elements it is impossible for the designer to create something that is enduring, true to character and effective. My role is to create design that speaks to strategy in the most universal form possible.

        3. Lastly, what would you be looking to do in this internship? What expectations do you have? What goals do you have? What do you want to learn about? What do you want to achieve?
      </div>

      <div class="goal">
        I could write paragraphs about what I want to achieve and to be honest, it would be alot of ramble because I'm not entirely sure. To summarise otherwise: <br> <br>
        Goal Un: I want to gain a better understanding of where my skills lie. <br>
        Goal Deux: I want to gain confidence in my own work and learn what it is like to collaborate with others. <br>
        Goal Trois: I want to learn how to design better - More effectively and more efficiently. <br>
        Goal Quatre: I want to learn the nitty gritty of the design process. How a brief turns into strategy into research into ideas and fnally into production.
