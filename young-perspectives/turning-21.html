      <h3 class="ind w3of4">It was around 5am when I got in the Uber home and the realisation set in that my friends would be showing up to my house in a few short hours.</h3>

      <div class="box">
        
        <div class="w1of4"></div>

        <h3 class=" w3of4 ind right">I appreciated the irony that I had told them all earlier that night to take it easy when I was the one that stumbled home with hickeys down my neck.</h3>

      </div> <br> <br> <br> <br>

      <p class="center">Upon everyones arrival there was champagne being poured, party poppers going off and photos being taken. I went inside with Andre and he gave me a card and some photo’s of us together framed. <span class="italic">The sentimentality of the gift and a moment of quiet was cherished</span> but short lived as the bus turned up a minute later. <br> <br>
      Boarding the bus was an enchanting bustle of good energy and excitement. The champagne was still being passed around and the music was pumping. <br> <br>
      I felt loved and thankful to have found this group of people, as during adolescence <span class="italic">I never truly felt apart of a group.</span></p> <br> <br> <br> <br>

      <div class="box">

      <h3 class="ind w3of4">From one winery to the next <span class="italic">my head felt progressively lighter</span> and <span class="italic">my cheeks hurt from laughing</span> and at the final winery the beautiful weather turned to pouring rain.</h3> <br> <br>

      <div class="box">
        
        <div class="w1of4"></div>

        <h3 class=" w3of4 ind right">Everyone else in the venue cleared out but we still decided to do the tasting huddled around a table undercover overlooking the rolling hills of the Yarra Valley; A picturesque scene under a sky now roaring with thunder.</h3>

The bus ride home I looked out as rain pinged aggressively off the windows. With two boxes of moscato consumed and the tunes still going strong, <span class="italic">we headed to the Gaso.</span></h3>
