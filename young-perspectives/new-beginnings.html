      <p class="border">Written by <span class="italic">Isabel Kate Hannebery</span></p> <br> <br>

      <h3 class="ind">Recently, I feel as though I have opened my eyes for the first time. These past few years have been a pocket of momentary bliss, leaving the rules of my childhood behind and <span class="italic">just scratching the surface of adult life.</span> <br> <br>
      This newfound freedom has shaken me awake. Never have I felt such change in my self growth and understanding, coming to truly realise what makes me tick, and who I am.</h3> <br> <br>

      <div class="box">
        <div class="w1of4"></div>
        <div class="w3of4"><h3 class="italic right">But this new awareness has led me to truly see everything and everyone around me with a pair of fresh eyes. 
        </h3></div>
      </div> <br> <br> <br> <br>

      <p class="center">Perhaps one of the most heartbreaking realisations I’ve had is the knowledge that not everyone views the world the way I do. <br> <br>
      Not everyone will feel things as deeply as I feel. Not everyone will try and give others the benefit of the doubt. Not everyone will have my back when I would have theirs. This was driven so wholly home when I experienced my first ever friendship breakup a few months ago. It is a new and raw kind of pain to have the ones you never expected to turn on you, do just that. <br> <br>
      <span class="italic">I have always believed that the best things in life come from struggle.</span></p> <br> <br> <br> <br>

      <div class="story">

      <h4 class="right border">"The hurt, tears and disbelief that come from such an experience are not just negative emotions."</h4> <br> <br> <br> <br>
      <h3 class="ind"> These kinds of life experiences are a chance to turn inward, to rebuild, and to recognise who you are. It is in these moments of struggle that we get at the core of what it means to be young, to be alive, and to be human. 
      </h3> <br> <br>

      <div class="box">
        <div class="w1of4"></div>
        <div class="w3of4"><h3 class="italic right">My brother always used to say that we cannot change our external, but we can control our internal. It was tough saying goodbye to such an integral part of my life for so many years. But I am grateful it happened, because from those ashes I have been given a new lease of life.
