        <div class="par">RT Edgar is a brand that has been around for over 120 years and their marketing leverages heavily off their experience and traditional heritage. As such, this placed down quite strict guidelines in regards to their graphic style.</div>

        <div class="par">With emphasis on older professionals usually wealthy with a number of properties in their portfolio, the digital side of RT Edgar was not heavily relied upon as most of the client base was developed over time. RT Edgar wanted to strengthen their digital presence which involved innovating a number of their current collaterals and creating accessible digital touchpoints for the franchise to use.</div>

        <div class="par">In leading the ‘digital revolution’ of RT Edgar, magazines were created in an online, interactive format including a variety of EDM templates, we also updated a number of Letterbox Drops to still efficiently appeal to the older demographic. The largest piece of work was a styleguide which summarised the entire Brand Refresh including Real Estate Boards, Stationary, Newspaper Ads and Publications.</div> <br> <br>
