        <div class="par">The style in place was one that communicated prestige and luxe, RT Edgar is a brand that has been around for over 120 years and their marketing leverages heavily off their experience and traditional heritage. As such, this placed down quite strict guidelines in regards to font, colour and language.</div>

        <div class="par">The audience is predominately older professionals usually wealthy with a number of properties in their portfolio. As such, the digital side of RT Edgar was not heavily relied upon as most of the client base was developed over time. The ultimate goal was to create a perception for potential vendors and clients that listing with RT Edgar is a notable, luxurious and prominent occasion. Hence, property needed to be presented in a sleek and grand way.</div>

        <div class="par">The development of multiple magazines including the Market Wrap and ‘Listing with RT Edgar’ booklet presented houses in a formal, luxe layout making the initial conversations with clients special. Other outcomes included a variety of Letterbox Drops and Collateral that seek to advertise properties and put RT Edgar at the forefront of the Realty industry.</div>

        <div class="par">In leading the ‘digital revolution’ of RT Edgar, magazines were then created in an online, interactive format including a variety of EDM templates that efficiently and conveniently engaged with the clientele.</div>

        <div class="par">The largest piece of work was a styleguide that outlined the full brand refresh including boards, printed material, stationary, brochures and newspaper advertisements.</div>
