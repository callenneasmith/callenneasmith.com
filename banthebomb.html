        <div class="par">Nuclear Disarmament concerns the masses of nuclear warheads stockpiled for deployment in 2020. Nuclear War is a pressing and absolutely catastrophic event.</div>

        <div class="par">‘Ban the Bomb’ is a revitalised campaign from the 1960s utlilising a modern and brutalist approach to driving awareness to the global issue.</div>

        <div class="par">Contrary to the original campaign which presented itself in a more light-heart and friendly manner, 'Ban the Bomb' adapts a bold, confronting design style to evoke fear from the audience to ultimately drive awareness to the issue.</div>

        <div class="par">Inspired by the bleak and arguably traumatic nature of Victorian Government 'Drink Driving' campaigns, the typography is solemn and the messages are alarming. Specifically, the alarming content selected regarding masses of nuclear warheads stockpiled today and references to their incredibly catastrophic power and presence (Mention of the Goldboro Crash). Other inspirations include the stark and confronting nature of the Doomsday Clock, a reminder of Nuclear War in 2020.</div>

        <div class="par">The audience was naturally quite widely defined due to the nature of socio-global issues, however this campaign targeted an audience of young adults who will most likely care for the longevity of the planet and who are most likely aware of the destruction nuclear weapons cause.</div>

        <div class="par">Engagement with the community is mostly done through the use of posters and brochures, easily accessible and designed to present a clear message relying on high exposures in public. These posters are hypothetically posted onto historical landmarks and areas such as the Berlin Wall and The Parliament of Australia where they are most likely to be seen by persons actively engaged in social justice. Furthermore, classicly made badges and stickers encourage the user to be an advocate for the issue acting as a secondary means of better informing the public to the nature of nuclear war and the need for disarmament.</div>
