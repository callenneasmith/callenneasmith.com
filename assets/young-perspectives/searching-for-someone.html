      <p class="border">Written by <span class="italic">Olivia Maree Davis</span></p> <br> <br>

      <h3 class="ind">As soon as I stepped off the bus into the sweltering heat of Tocumwal with bags lobbed over my shoulders, the vastness of space overwhelmed me. <span class="italic">Dust was flying into my eyes and people were walking about everywhere. </span>I felt out of body, looking around trying to piece together left from right in the haboob around me.</h3> <br> <br>

      <div class="box">
        <div class="w1of4"></div>
        <div class="w3of4 italic"><h3>I tried calling once, twice, three times to find him, a familiarity in the unfamiliar.</h3></div>
      </div> <br> <br> <br> <br>

      <p class="center">After a chaotic start we managed to get out onto the dance floor. I was subconsciously scanning the faces of every person hoping to find him but knew it would be unlikely. I felt deflated. No reception and thousands of people bouncing in synergy under the flashing lights, <br> <br>
      I tried to sway along, smile and play the part.</p> <br> <br> <br> <br>

      <div class="box">

        <div class="w2of4">

          <div class="w1of4"></div>
          <div class="w3of4 pa aic ind dsg"><h3>I wanted to be enjoying myself but I felt disconnected. Everyone kept asking me if i was having a good time with <span class="italic">their pupils dilated and gum smacking</span> in my ear. I nodded but inside I felt out of place and like i wanted to disappear.</h3></div>  
      </div> <br> <br> <br> <br>

      <p class="center">Security for me is controlled, intimate environments or him. Strawberry Fields was unequivocally none of the aforementioned. When we made it back to camp I checked my tent was locked 5 times as I was afraid someone would try to come in. With everything slowing down I felt an anxious sadness creep over me and I wished the boys were there with us. <br> <br>
      Later that night I heard rustling and a voice amongst the cracking of nangs, far off music and the chatter of passerbys. I unlocked my tent and ran out to give him a massive hug.</p> <br> <br> <br> <br>

      <h3 class="italic right">The weight of 1000 bricks lifted off my chest. I didn’t have to search anymore, it would be okay.</h3>
