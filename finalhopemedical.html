        <div class="par">Within the climate of COVID-19, we look to a vaccine to leave the COVID Normal State. ‘Final Hope Medical’ is a conceptual pharmaceutical company responsible for distributing vaccines in a pandemic. A bold, brutalist graphic style captures the attention of young adults who may be reluctant to get vaccinated.</div>

        <div class="par">Inspired by Graphic Artist Patrick Thomas, the use of conceptual and abstract symbolism within his works such 'Automation' convey messages in a memorable and unique manner. Despite no direct correlation, the range and consistent graphic style is enduring and engaging.</div>

        <div class="par">Targeted at young adults, graphics and symbols are modern, bold and minimalist in appearance however compelling enough to break through the incredibly saturated nature of social media with intense colour and contrast.</div>

        <div class="par">User Interaction intends to drive the young adult to their nearest vaccination center whether that be via Instagram stories linked to a website or the mass printed business cards with QR codes used to redirect the user. Packaging remains consistent with the design style enacted across the campaign and is the final element between the user being first exposed to 'Final Hope Medical' and being immunised.</div><br>
